==========

Minijax is for developers who **love standards** and **hate bloat**.

Minijax is a lightweight subset of Java EE standards such as JAX-RS (REST), dependency injection, JSON, WebSockets, and more.

**Why Java?**  Java continues to be one of the most popular programming languages in existence.  It is hardened and battle tested.  It is fast and ubiquitous.

**Why not just use Java EE?**  Java EE application servers are big and unwieldy.  There is a growing trend toward Java SE + a subset of Java EE API's, and then using "fat jars" as popularized by [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io) and [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/).

**Why Java EE API's?** Despite the weight and hassle of Java EE, the API's themselves can be quite elegant.  By using standard API's, you inherit standardized documentation and engineers who are familiar with the design.  By using standard API's, you can future proof your project.

**How lightweight?** We have been vigilant with dependencies.  The ["Hello World" example](https://minijax.org/minijax-examples/minijax-example-hello/dependencies.html) is around 2 MB including all dependencies.

**How fast?** All benchmarks are suspect, but Minijax holds its own.
